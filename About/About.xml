    Storage Crates is a mod focused on compact and neat stockpiling of bulk resources.
    The basic structure is you build some plates, then assemble the steel plates plus your stack of 75 
    of any resource (500 for gold/silver) and produce the crate.

    You then can stack the crates in a stockpile like any other item and they stack to 75. 
    For a total of 5625 of a non-currency resource on a single tile.

    You can also pack meat/veggies into a canned meal that does not spoil.
    You can then even pack the meat/veggie cans into a crate for storage too.

    Crates Process:
     Raw Resources + Machining Table = Steel Plates,
      Steel Plates + Full single stack of resources + Packing Bench = 1 single crate of that resource.

    Food Can Process:
     Raw Resources + Machining Table = Steel Plates, 
      Steel Plates + Machining Table = Can, Can + Butcher Table + 5 meat or veggies = Meal Can

    Known issues : 
    !*!*!- DO NOT Force Unpack more than 1 crate, DO NOT force unpack a stack of 2+ crates. !*!*!

    Special thanks to Nasikabatrachus for the original idea
